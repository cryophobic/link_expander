# Link Expander

This is a utility I'm working on to unfurl (multiple) URLs that are shortened or go through multiple redirects (i.e. those bundled in some newsletters etc)

It has the ability to output as CSV, TXT, or straight to the command line.

Additionally, it fetches the page title and includes it in the output. This is particularly useful for collecting a group of urls from a page, and then knowing exactly what they all point to.

I will continue to update this project, and will be making it modular so that I can run the main component as an API.
